Wrapper to add [Unity User Reporting](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.cloud.userreporting.html) as an external dependency. This is a convenience package to import Unity User Reporting in Unity 2019.3, but is **a work in progress**. This package will eventually also contain some modifications to the base SDK to better suit our games. Till then, consider using [this repo](github.com/gamedev-iitk/UserReporting) as a Git submodule instead.
